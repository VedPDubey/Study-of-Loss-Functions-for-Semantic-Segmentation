<h1>A Study of Loss Functions for Semantic Segmentation</h1>
Image Segmentation has been an active Ô¨Åeld of research as it has a wide range of applications, ranging from automated disease detection to self driving cars. Various papers  have come up with different objective loss functions used in different cases such as sparse data, biased data etc. In this poster, I have summarized some of the well-known loss functions widely used for Semantic Segmentation and listed out the cases where their usage can help in fast and better convergence of a model. The dataset used is a combination of the NLM  Montgomery County and China Set - The Shenzhen set - Chest X-ray Database upon which we have to  perform the task of  binary semantic segmentation.
